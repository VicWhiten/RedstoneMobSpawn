This plugin allows you to use redstone circuts to spawn creatures on your server.  A monster is spawned by powering a sign with redstone in any way.  The sign must be powered, must be a free standing sign (not on a wall), and must follow this syntax:

Sign Syntax:
------------------------
|        MOBSPAWN      |
|  [name of creature]  |
|<BlockFace> <distance>|
|                      |
------------------------

Where name of creature is whatever you want to spawn, BlockFace is a cardinal direction (I.E. north, east, south_west, north_west), and distance is the number of blocks in that direction you want the mob to spawn.  If you don't provide a distance, it is assumed to be 1.  If you completely omit the 3rd line, the creature will be spawned on the sign.

EXAMPLES:
------------------------
|        MOBSPAWN      |
|        zombie        |
|         up 2         |
|                      |
------------------------
This will spawn a zombie 2 blocks above the sign, useful for putting signs under a block to hide them.

------------------------
|        MOBSPAWN      |
|          pig         |
|         north        |
|                      |
------------------------
This will spawn a pig one block to the north of the sign


------------------------
|        MOBSPAWN      |
|         creeper      |
|                      |
|                      |
------------------------
This will spawn a creeper on the sign.  Hope you aren't nearby!
